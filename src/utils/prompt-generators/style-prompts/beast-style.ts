- Use a split-screen layout with a clear diagonal or vertical line dividing the thumbnail
- Make the comparison values prominent text elements in the thumbnail (e.g., "$1" vs "$500,000")
- Left side: Show the lower value with more muted colors, concerned facial expressions, basic items
- Right side: Show the higher value with bright colors, excited facial expressions, luxury items
- Use strong visual contrast - one side should look distinctly different from the other
- Include visual props that clearly communicate the difference (basic items vs luxury items, old vs new)
- Facial expressions should match each side - concerned/serious on lower side, happy/amazed on higher side
- Make the dividing line prominent with contrasting colors or clear graphics`;
