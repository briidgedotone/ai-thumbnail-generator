# Step 2 Summary: Enhanced Error Handling

## Changes Made

### 1. Standardized API Error Responses
- Implemented consistent error response format across all API routes: `{ error: string, details?: any, code?: string }`
- Updated the following API endpoints:
  - `generate-thumbnail/route.ts`
  - `generate-content/route.ts`
  - `analyze-prompt/route.ts`
  - `save-project/route.ts`
- Added appropriate HTTP status codes for different error types (400, 401, 500, 502, 503)
- Added error codes for more precise error handling (e.g., 'MISSING_API_KEY', 'INVALID_RESPONSE_STRUCTURE')

### 2. User-Facing Error Messages
- Created a helper function `handleApiError()` in `studio-view.tsx` to convert API errors to user-friendly messages
- Implemented specific user messages based on error types:
  - Missing API keys: "The service is currently unavailable. Please try again later or contact support."
  - API errors: "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few moments."
  - Invalid responses: "We received an unexpected response from our AI service. Please try again."
- Added success notifications for completed operations:
  - "Project saved successfully!"
  - "Successfully regenerated title/description/tags!"
  - "Image regenerated successfully!"

### 3. Error Boundary Component
- Created a reusable `ErrorBoundary` component in `src/components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`
- Implemented default error fallback UI with retry functionality
- Applied the ErrorBoundary to critical components in the dashboard:
  - Wrapped `StudioView` with error recovery logic to reset state on failure
  - Wrapped `ProjectsView` to prevent errors from crashing the entire app

## Impact and Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: The application can now handle errors gracefully without crashing or displaying confusing technical messages to users.

2. **Better User Experience**: Users receive clear, actionable feedback when something goes wrong, with appropriate toast notifications.

3. **Easier Debugging**: Standardized error formats with error codes make it easier for developers to identify and fix issues.

4. **Graceful Degradation**: When external services (like OpenAI or Gemini) are unavailable, the application provides appropriate fallbacks and clear messaging.

5. **Maintainability**: Consistent error handling patterns across the application make it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.

## Next Steps

The application now has robust error handling, but still requires improvements in other areas:
- Environment variable management
- Loading state standardization
- Security enhancements
- Component refactoring
- Testing implementation
